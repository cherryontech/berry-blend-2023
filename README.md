**Blisssfull** is an innovative wellness initiative addressing the pervasive issue of work burnout. Committed to enhancing the well-being of women and non-binary working professionals, our project is designed to recommend self-care activities for individuals experiencing burnout. Activities are recommended based on someone’s perceived energy level, separated from low and high, which is determined through a questionnaire.
